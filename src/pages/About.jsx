      <p id="explanation">This page serves as a way to elaborate a little more on the purpose of this project. This project is
        intended to help you find the best place to travel based on the kind of weather you enjoy. This will be based on the weather that
        is currently taking place. Using weather APIs you will be able to
        gather several pieces of weather information such as temperature, UV Index, wind speed, and more. The data you will be 
        able to access is limited to the data in the backend database. Enjoy using the application !
