## How To Run This Project:

## 1. General Overview: This is a simple project that uses an multiple APIs. One is a randome picture generator 
## in the Home Page, the other tracks the weather and is part of the actual project. 

## 2. System Design: This app was built with react and is made up of multiple components. You will need to install react
## in order to run this app. You will see in the source folder the main pages are in the pages folder. The components necessary for the pages to function is in a folder called components, and any js files that are required for utility for the components to work are in the utils folder. There is also a global css file called App.css that handles all css in the app.

## 3. Starting the Project: Open a new terminal and type "npm start" once you have react installed and the files ready.
## This will open the app in a new browser on your computer. 

## 4. Known Bugs: Some variables in the weather API will return "N/A" as they are undefined. 

## 5. Dev Suggestions: I recommend finding ways to fix undefined variables.
